# Decisions Log (ADRs)

Why this project's conventions are what they are. Each entry records a decision,
the reasoning behind it, and what it constrains when you build.

These are **inherited from the starter** — they explain the rules in `AGENTS.md`
and across the vault, and notes link to them by number. Add your project's own
decisions on top, continuing the numbering. Amending an inherited decision is
fine; write a new ADR that says so rather than editing the old one.

Template: [[templates/adr-note]].

## ADR-0023 — Compile the page's GPU pipelines under the preloader

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-09-12

**Decision.** The preloader panel carries `GpuWarmup` — invisible samples, one
per GPU pipeline the page below the fold needs — so Chrome compiles them while
the panel hides the page, not on the first scroll. The sample list is taken
from Chrome's trace (`createGraphicsPipeline`), never from reasoning about CSS.

**Why.** On a first visit the scroll from the hero froze 7–8 times for up to
~600 ms, and three more times as the hero entered. The trace put every freeze on
the GPU thread compiling a pipeline for a paint combination seen for the first
time (Skia Graphite on Dawn/Metal: synchronous, 190–400 ms each). The skill's
§3 ("prewarm everything in the loader") was written for WebGL scenes; the page's
own DOM paint is subject to the same rule, and the preloader is the one moment
a compile costs nothing visible. Alternatives, each measured:

- **A frozen clone of each section behind the panel** — 4.7 s, and it missed
  every pipeline that belongs to an animation *state* (a layer mid-fade, a cup
  mid-turn). Rejected.
- **Scrolling the real page under the panel** — would spend every `mode="once"`
  reveal before the visitor arrives (they latch on intersection). Rejected.
- **Hand-made "equivalent" samples** — compiled different programs every time:
  Blink turns a radial gradient with a stop past 100% into a two-point conical,
  an even-odd path turns its whole tile multisampled, a one-tile layer and a
  multi-tile one sample differently. Hence the rule to sample the real effect.
- **Removing the effects** — design, not ours to cut.

**Trade-offs.** The list is empirical and tied to how this Chrome draws. A
stale sample costs nothing, but a *missing* one brings a freeze back — on first
visits only, so it hides from anyone testing on a warm machine. One pipeline
(a translucent layer at a sub-pixel offset — the locations dial fading in) is
not reproduced; the residual is ~200 ms on first visits, documented in
[[changelog]]. Compile time moves into the preloader, which on a cold cache
already stalled 1.4–2.1 s for the hero's own programs. Only Chrome on macOS was
measured; other engines compile differently and are untested here.

**When building.** After any visual change below the fold — a new gradient, a
blend, a clipped or transformed layer — re-run the cold trace in
[[optimize-3d-scene]] and add a sample for anything compiled during the scroll.
Sample the real effect (export it, as `blobMask` is), keep multisampled samples
in their own layer, never use a flat colour or `opacity-0`. Measure cold: warm
runs lie, because the macOS Metal cache survives fresh browser profiles.

## ADR-0022 — Track latest within majors; hold TypeScript 7 and ESLint 10

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-08-18

**Decision.** Dependencies track the newest release **within their current
major**. Three majors are deliberately held back.

**Why.** Stale pins hand every new project a migration debt on day one; a broken
toolchain is worse. Each hold was tested, not assumed:

- **TypeScript 5, not 7** — `eslint-config-next` depends on `typescript-eslint@8`,
  whose peer range is `typescript >=4.8.4 <6.1.0`. TS 7 breaks `yarn lint`.
- **ESLint 9, not 10** — ESLint 10 removed `context.getFilename()`;
  `eslint-plugin-react` still calls it, so linting dies on startup.
- **`@types/node` tracks the Node major in use**, not the newest published.

**When building.** The blockers live in someone else's dependency graph, so they
lift without work here — **re-test periodically** rather than treating them as
permanent. [[tech-stack]] carries the table and the reasons. Node ≥ 20.19 is a
hard floor (`engines` + `.nvmrc`): the ESLint toolchain fails to install below it.

## ADR-0021 — SEO is a practice with a workflow, not just a metadata helper

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-08-18

**Decision.** SEO and AEO get skills, an audit agent and a documented order of
work ([[seo-aeo]]), not just the metadata utilities.

**Why.** The mechanism existed; the practice did not. Nothing checked whether a
new route reached `sitemap.ts`, whether titles were unique, or whether the site
was legible to answer engines — the fastest-moving part of search and the one
most likely to be skipped.

**When building.** Audit in order: indexability → metadata → content structure →
structured data → performance → AEO. A perfectly optimised page that cannot be
crawled is worth nothing. **AI-crawler policy is the user's decision** — "be
cited by AI" and "don't train on my content" need different bots allowed. Never
cloak, and never emit schema describing content that is not on the page.

---

## ADR-0020 — Payload + Supabase are the CMS and database, added per project

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-08-18

**Decision.** Payload (Postgres adapter) on Supabase are the documented defaults.
**Neither ships in the starter** — the `payload-cms` / `supabase-db` skills
install them when a project needs them.

**Why.** Payload runs *inside* the Next app — admin as a route group, content via
an in-process Local API, types generated from the schema — which matches how this
starter already works (Server Components reading data, passing props down) and
keeps deployment one Vercel project. Supabase covers database, media bucket and
optional auth in one service. Most projects from this starter are marketing sites
that never need either, so an unused install would be a large dependency surface
and a migration story maintained for nothing.

**When building.** [[cms-payload]] and [[database-supabase]] carry the
conventions. Two constraints break installs if ignored: `@payloadcms/next` pins a
minimum Next version (verify before installing), and Supabase's connection
strings are not interchangeable — runtime on the transaction pooler (6543, no
prepared statements), migrations on the direct connection (5432).

## ADR-0019 — Hard rules get a mechanical check, not just prose

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-08-18

**Decision.** `.claude/scripts/verify.sh` checks every hard rule that is
objectively decidable from source and exits non-zero on any FAIL. Judgement calls
stay with the `qa-verify` skill.

**Why.** Rules that are never checked decay into suggestions, and silently — a
stray `@keyframes` or hardcoded hex surfaces at review, if at all. `yarn lint`
knows nothing about springs, token tiers or route delegation.

**When building.** Run it after any code change ([[qa-verification]]). It greps
rather than parsing TypeScript, so it is biased toward false positives: a
dismissed warning costs seconds, an unchecked rule costs a review cycle. WARNs
never fail a build, so justify them rather than ignoring them.

---

## ADR-0018 — Split the docs into knowledge (vault) and execution (`.claude/`)

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-08-18

**Decision.** The vault stays the single source of truth for *why* and *what*;
`.claude/` holds *how it runs* — path-scoped rules, skills, agents, commands and
the verify script ([[agent-harness]]). Every skill, agent and command is
registered in the vault.

**Why.** Documentation that cannot be executed gets skipped; execution files
without recorded reasoning drift and duplicate. Keeping each mechanism to one job
avoids both.

**When building.** `.claude/` files stay short and point into the vault rather
than restating it — restated rules drift out of sync. **Path-scoped rules fire
when Claude *reads* a matching file, not when it writes one, and are not
re-injected after `/compact`.** They reinforce; they never guarantee. Anything
that must hold unconditionally belongs in `verify.sh` or a hook.

---

## ADR-0017 — A skill states its preconditions and its own internal conflicts

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-07-24

**Decision.** Every skill must state the environment its measurements assume, and
name explicitly where one of its steps undermines another.

**Why.** `optimize-3d-scene` was run on a real scene and the fix *order* held up
— what cost hours was everything left implicit: a first step that could not be
executed on the stack in front of it, measurements silently invalidated by the
dev server, and two individually correct steps that contradicted each other.

**When building.** When writing or editing a skill: a step names its
preconditions, and a step names where it fights another step. Numbers taken in
the wrong environment are worse than no numbers, because they read as evidence.

---

## ADR-0016 — Skills are registered in the vault, not just dropped in `.claude/`

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-07-24

**Decision.** A skill is only "installed" once it lives in `.claude/skills/<name>/`,
has a vault note under `workflows/`, is linked from [[README]] and
[[ai-agent-guide]], and — if invocation should be non-optional — has a routing
rule in `AGENTS.md`.

**Why.** A skill folder is discoverable to Claude Code at runtime but invisible in
the vault, leaving the invocation decision to model judgement. Where the skill
exists *because the order of operations matters*, that is exactly the wrong thing
to leave to chance.

**When building.** Registration is also when a skill gets checked against reality
— stale paths and references to files that do not exist surface here.

---

## ADR-0015 — Strict three-tier design-token naming convention

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-07-17 · amends ADR-0004

**Decision.** Tokens follow three tiers with an explicit grammar: primitive
`--raw-<category>-<name>[-<shade>]` → semantic `--<role>[-<variant>][-<state>]` →
`@theme inline` binding. Only Tier 1 holds literals; Tier 2 names purpose, never
appearance, and is the themeable layer. No tier may be skipped.

**Why.** ADR-0004 made tokens the styling currency but never said what a token
should be *called*, so every project would invent its own — defeating the point of
a shared starter. The names are predictable across projects by design.

**When building.** Full rules in [[design-system]]. Two Tailwind v4 facts,
verified by compiling a probe stylesheet, that guides commonly get wrong:

1. Naming primitives `--color-*` would **generate a utility for every raw value**
   and let markup bypass the semantic tier — hence the `--raw-*` prefix, kept out
   of `@theme`.
2. **There is no `--duration-*` namespace.** `duration-fast` compiles to nothing.
   Durations stay Tier 2 and are used as `duration-[var(--duration-fast)]`.
   (`--ease-*` *is* real.)

`@theme inline` is load-bearing: `inline` inlines the `var()` into each utility so
Tier 2 overrides cascade. Binding a literal there freezes the value and silently
breaks theming.

## ADR-0014 — Narrow CSS-transition exception for trivial state changes

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-07-17 · amends ADR-0002

**Decision.** All real motion stays spring-based, with one exception: CSS
`transition-*` for simple discrete state changes — `hover:` / `focus-visible:` /
`active:` colour, opacity, border, underline, and small decorative nudges.

**Why.** The outright ban cost most where it helped least: a nav link fading its
colour on hover needed a client component and a spring config to animate one
property nobody will interrupt. The rule pushed toward boilerplate or quiet
rule-breaking.

**When building.** Three conditions, all required, or it is a spring:
token-backed timing (`duration-[var(--duration-fast)] ease-entrance`),
`transition-*` only (`@keyframes` stay banned outright), and utilities only —
never a CSS file. Everything scroll-driven, revealing, staggered, orchestrated,
layout-affecting or interruptible remains a spring; text stays [[text-engine]].
The list is enumerated rather than a judgement call ("simple animations") so it
cannot erode into general CSS animation. Past the list, use `<Hover>`.

---

## ADR-0013 — `<Inview>` self-observe fix; spring components honour resize

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-06-07

**Decision.** Second authorised edit to the protected engine: `<Inview>` now
calls its callback ref so it observes itself when no `trigger` is passed, and
`<Inview>` / `<Spring>` / `<Hover>` pass the React-tracked `width` into
`isMobileDisabled(value, width)`.

**Why.** `<Inview>` only animated when given an external `trigger` — the common
case silently did nothing, because a callback ref was being assigned as
`.current` instead of called. Separately the `width` dependency was tracked but
never used, so resize re-evaluation of mobile gating did nothing.

**When building.** The springs folder stays `#do-not-modify` by default — these
were explicitly signed-off bug fixes, not an opening.

---

## ADR-0012 — Styling lives in utilities and components, not `globals.css`

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05-22 · amends ADR-0004

**Decision.** A strict placement order, first match wins:

| Situation | Goes where |
|-----------|-----------|
| One-off styling | Tailwind utilities in `className` |
| Repeated pattern with markup/structure/props | a **React component** in `components/ui/` |
| Repeated pure-utility combo, no structure | a Tailwind v4 `@utility` |
| Pseudo-elements, 3rd-party overrides, complex selectors | `@layer components` |
| A new colour/spacing/radius value | a token (per ADR-0015) |

**Why.** With tokens in `globals.css` and guidance to extract repeated patterns
into `@layer components`, the path of least resistance made that file a dumping
ground — hundreds of component-specific classes never deleted when their
component was. Splitting the file would only spread the same bloat; the fix is a
placement rule.

**When building.** The default answer to "this looks repeated" is a **React
component**, not a CSS class — an eyebrow label with a `::before` dot is an
`<Eyebrow>`, not a `.label-eyebrow`. `globals.css` holds imports, tokens, base
resets and the narrow `@layer components` exceptions; if it grows past that,
something was misplaced. **CSS Modules were considered and rejected** — a second
styling mechanism is not worth the mental model when motion is spring-based (no
keyframes to co-locate) and utilities plus components cover everything else.

---

## ADR-0011 — API layer: `app/api` route handlers, secrets server-side

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05-22

**Decision.** External calls go through Next.js Route Handlers at
`src/app/api/<resource>/route.ts`. The handler owns the work — business logic,
upstream calls, filtering, secret env vars. No mandatory passthrough service
layer; extract shared code only when genuinely reused.

**Why.** `route.ts` is never bundled to the browser, so it is the natural place
for secrets, and a single convention keeps every endpoint the same shape.

**When building.** Every endpoint validates input with `zod` and returns the
`{ data }` / `{ error }` envelope via the shared `handle()` wrapper. Secret env
vars are unprefixed and read through `getServerEnv()`; `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is only for
browser-safe values. Client Components fetch same-origin via `apiFetch`;
render-time data is read in Server Components. Full note: [[api-architecture]].
Server Actions were considered for mutations and deferred — revisit with a new
ADR if forms need progressive enhancement.

---

## ADR-0010 — SEO & performance hardening

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05-21

**Decision.** `src/lib/site.ts` (`siteConfig`) is the single source of truth for
SEO. `metadataBase` is always set; `themeColor` lives on the `viewport` export.
Added `robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts`, JSON-LD, `loading.tsx` / `error.tsx` /
`not-found.tsx`, and `<ReducedMotion>`.

**Why.** Relative OG/canonical URLs never resolved to absolute, so social
previews broke in production; an animation-heavy starter ignored
`prefers-reduced-motion`; and the home view was a top-level `"use client"`,
breaking the server-first rule it should model.

**When building.** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in every deployed environment or
canonical and OG URLs resolve to localhost. `<ReducedMotion>` toggles
react-spring's global `skipAnimation` from one app-root mount, covering every
spring and the text engine at once. **`isBot()` is discouraged** — it opts the
route out of static rendering and edges toward cloaking; reduced motion is the
preferred lever, since springs only animate opacity/transform and content is in
the DOM for crawlers regardless ([[seo-metadata]]).

---

## ADR-0009 — Shared animation ticker; authorised engine performance refactor

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05-21 · amends ADR-0002

**Decision.** One-time authorised refactor of the protected engine, plus a shared
loop primitive: `src/lib/animation/ticker.ts` — a single app-wide,
reference-counted rAF loop that starts on the first subscriber and stops on the
last. It is **not** `#do-not-modify`; it is the supported extension point.

**Why.** Cost scaled with the number of animated components: a private rAF loop
per `useLoop` instance that never stopped, a debounced `resize` listener per
spring component, and an `IntersectionObserver` re-created on every render.

**When building.** A page with N animated components now runs **one** rAF loop
and **one** resize listener. Subscribe new per-frame work to the ticker rather
than starting a loop. Hard rule #2 was amended here: the engine stays protected
by default and changes need explicit sign-off — this ADR is not a precedent for
editing it.

---

## ADR-0008 — Adaptive scaling grid via root font-size

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05-21

**Decision.** Keep a rem-based design proportional across viewports by scaling
`html { font-size }`: `vw`-based media queries in `globals.css` for scaling down,
and a `<AdaptiveGrid>` client component for scaling up beyond the largest
breakpoint.

**Why.** The behaviour arrived as a `styled-components` implementation, which is
not a project dependency and conflicts with the CSS-only config rule. Only the
behaviour was kept; the implementation was rebuilt on the project stack.

**When building.** Breakpoints live in `grid.config.ts` **and** are mirrored in
the `globals.css` media queries — duplicated by design, since ADR-0004 forbids
generating CSS config from JS. **Keep the two in sync**; the formula is written
in both files. Design px map cleanly to rem at the design base width.

---

## ADR-0007 — Automate the vault workflow with Claude Code hooks

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05-21

**Decision.** Encode the "read the vault first, update the docs after" workflow as
hooks in `.claude/settings.json`: `SessionStart` injects a pointer to the vault,
`UserPromptSubmit` reminds the agent to consult the relevant guide,
and `Stop` blocks **once per turn** to confirm docs were updated.

**Why.** Documentation drifts the moment it depends on someone remembering.

**When building.** The `Stop` hook uses a `${TMPDIR}` marker keyed by session id
so it blocks at most once per turn — no infinite loop. Hooks are reviewable and
disableable via `/hooks`, and take effect at the next session start.

---

## ADR-0006 — The vault is the single source of truth

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05-21 · amends ADR-0001

**Decision.** The vault is the **only** documentation source. The repo root keeps
thin shims: `AGENTS.md` carries the breaking-change warning and hard rules and
points into the vault; `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursorrules` `@`-import it.

**Why.** Dense spec files at the root duplicated the vault's content as terse
specs, and the two would drift.

**When building.** Put documentation in the vault and link to it. Keep the root
shims consistent with it — they are the first thing every agent reads.

---

## ADR-0005 — Use standard `next/link` for navigation

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-05-21

**Decision.** Standard Next.js navigation — `<Link>` from `next/link`,
`useRouter` from `next/navigation`. The custom `<AnimLink>` / `useAnimRouter()`
convention referenced in early drafts is dropped; it was never built.

**Why.** Two conflicting conventions existed in the docs and only one had code.

**When building.** No animated route-transition layer exists. If one is needed,
revisit with a new ADR rather than reviving the old names. See [[routing]].

---

## ADR-0004 — Tailwind v4 with CSS-based config

**Status:** Accepted (starter baseline) · amended by ADR-0012 and ADR-0015

**Decision.** All theme configuration lives in `globals.css` under `:root` and
`@theme inline`. There is no `tailwind.config.js`. Raw values in class names are
banned.

**Why.** Tailwind v4 removes the JS config file in favour of CSS-native config.

**When building.** Design tokens are the only styling currency: a value that does
not exist as a token gets added to `globals.css` first — following the three-tier
grammar (ADR-0015) — and component-specific *classes* do not go there at all
(ADR-0012). See [[design-system]].

---

## ADR-0003 — Routes delegate to Views

**Status:** Accepted (starter baseline)

**Decision.** `app/**/page.tsx` only imports and renders a component from
`src/views/`. All layout and UI logic lives in the view.

**Why.** Mixing routing concerns with page UI makes `app/` files heavy and hard
to test.

**When building.** Every route is a ~3-line file; views are the real page
components. `verify.sh` FAILs on a route importing anything else. See [[routing]].

---

## ADR-0002 — All motion is spring-based (`@react-spring/web`)

**Status:** Accepted (starter baseline) · amended by ADR-0014 and ADR-0009

**Decision.** Every animation uses `@react-spring/web` through the component
layer in `src/components/animation/springs/`. CSS keyframes and `framer-motion`
are **banned**. Text animation goes through `spring-text-engine`.

**Why.** Marketing sites need rich, interruptible, physically natural motion. CSS
transitions and keyframes are rigid; competing libraries add weight.

**When building.** The springs folder and `src/hooks/animation/` are
`#do-not-modify` — consume them, wrap them, never edit them without sign-off.
ADR-0014 narrows the CSS ban to allow `transition-*` for trivial hover/focus
state only. See [[animation-system]] and [[text-engine]].

---

## ADR-0001 — Adopt an Obsidian vault as the project brain

**Status:** Accepted (starter baseline) · amended by ADR-0006

**Decision.** `obsidian/` is a linked, navigable vault documenting how the
project is built and why.

**Why.** Project knowledge scattered across root markdown files gave new
contributors and AI agents no structured map of the system.

**When building.** Docs are maintained alongside code — see [[meta/README]] for
the maintenance rules, and [[agent-harness]] for how the vault and `.claude/`
divide the work.
